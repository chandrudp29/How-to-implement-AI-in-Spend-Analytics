### Solutions
#### Identify and consolidate your spend data :
Your data may be stored in a variety of places. In many cases, each department – or even each project within each department – has a separate budget and accounting system. Each of these separate sources may have its own internal process:accounts payable, general ledger, eProcurement systems or other financial software. The first step is to identify all invoices and payments from all sources, and consolidate everything into one central database.
#### Create a supplier list :
- Identify the suppliers on your list with a tag or group designation in order to pull out and analyze prices
- Identify the best suppliers and tag them preferred.
- Benchmark suppliers based on the extent to which they follow the market trend
#### Categorize expenses :
Make a category for every major expense: Personnel, travel, outsourced programming, legal, manufacturing supplies, office supplies, etc.
#### Central dashboard :
- A central spend dashboard is a strategic tool for management to not only understand the cash flow and working capital needs but also to make better investment decisions
- Streamline your Procurement Process via a thorough understanding of your spend data.
- Real-time view into supplier pricing trends and contract compliance for better contract management

### AI Based Solutions :
#### What can we implement with AI in spend analysis ?
- AI can help finance teams review all spend by automatically approving low-risk expenses and invoices and flagging the high-risk ones for manual review.
- AI can integrate with contract management systems and other repositories to extract contract terms, make sense of those terms in business context, and notify auditors when invoices don’t comply.
#### Sniff out fraud
- AI can quickly and comprehensively scan for risk factors — from an inconsistent address on an invoice to a duplicate charge from a vendor to a suspicious business name on an expense report and more — to catch attempted fraud and reduce spend leakage.
-  AI systems can automatically approve low-risk invoices to proceed to payment and flag high-risk ones for manual review.
-  AI quickly detects reports that are likely to contain violations, such as duplicate receipts or out-of-policy expenses, so auditors can review them in more detail before processing.
- customers look there might be some risk with some of the suppliers that you’re working with because  we’re seeing some of our other buyers in aggregate having risks with those suppliers
#### Don’t double-pay
- AI can help prevent this problem by remembering all invoices and expense reports and their payments and always checking for duplicate spend.

## Benifits
### Keeping Your Spend Analysis Up-to-date
-  With an automated PurchaseControl system, you can use Budget Forecasting to stay on top of every dime your organization spends…and make sure it’s spent efficiently.
### Ensure contract terms are being fulfilled
- Verify that suppliers are delivering on their contracts, including turnaround times, quantities, and quality.
### Direct savings
- eliminating duplicate orders, or by reducing waste incurred by overbuying – which wastes money, man-hours, and storage space.
### Manage risk
- Dealing with preferred vendors may put your supply chain and project progress at risk if the vendor fails.
